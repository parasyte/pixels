# Hello Pixels

![Hello Pixels](../../img/minimal-sdl2.png)

Minimal example with SDL2 using `beryllium`.

## Running

```bash
cargo run --release --example minimal-sdl2 --features minimal-sdl2
```

## About

This example demonstrates the absolute minimum for creating an SDL2 window and pixel buffer. It animates a purple box moving on a blue background, just for _something_ interesting to display.

The example currently does not run on macOS. See [#47](https://github.com/parasyte/pixels/issues/47) for details.
