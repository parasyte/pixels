## Policy

The table above will be kept up-to-date in lock-step with CI on the main branch in GitHub. It may contain information about unreleased and yanked versions. It is the user's responsibility to consult with the [`pixels` versions page](https://crates.io/crates/pixels/versions) on `crates.io` to verify version status.

The MSRV will be chosen as the minimum version of `rustc` that can successfully pass CI, including documentation, lints, and all examples. For this reason, the minimum version _supported_ may be higher than the minimum version _required_ to compile the `pixels` crate itself. See `Cargo.toml` for the minimal Rust version required to build the crate alone.
